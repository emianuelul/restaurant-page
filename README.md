# restaurant-page

Project made for the Odin Project as a way to practice using Webpack and other npm packages / plugins / loaders. Images taken from stock sites except the picture of the 'cook' that is a random image I found on Google. The whole page is created inside the .js files, creating and appending stuff to the DOM.

## Things I Learned / Practiced

1. Basic grasp of npm
2. Basic use of Webpack and how to make a Webpack config
3. CSS and DOM manipulation.
